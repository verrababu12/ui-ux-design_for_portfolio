      <h1>UI/UX Design</h1>
      <p>
        My approach to UI/UX design focuses on creating user-centric experiences
        that are both visually appealing and highly functional. I believe that
        great design is about understanding user needs and crafting interfaces
        that are intuitive and engaging.
      </p>

      <h2>My Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        My UI/UX design process ensures that each project is tailored to provide
        the best possible user experience:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>User Research:</strong> Understanding the target audience
          through surveys, interviews, and analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wireframing:</strong> Creating low-fidelity wireframes to
          outline the structure and flow of the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prototyping:</strong> Building interactive prototypes to
          visualize the user journey and test functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visual Design:</strong> Designing the final look and feel of
          the interface, focusing on color schemes, typography, and branding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Testing:</strong> Gathering feedback from users to refine
          and improve the design before launch.
        </li>
      </ol>
